# A LaTeX Slide Template for Purdue University

A LaTeX beamer slide template inspired by [Purdue CS Brand Guide](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/media/brand_guide.html).

## Overleaf

~~You can use it on Overleaf [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-purdue-latex-slide-template/zxfwvccrcmks).~~

Overleaf appears to be bugged for SVG files in TeX 2022 (with Inkscape version 1.1). It is recommended to either use TeX 2021 on Overleaf or to compile locally (with Inkscape version < 1.0).

### Purdue Logo

By using the Purdue Logos and its co-brand logos, you acknowledge that Purdue University is the owner of the “Purdue” name and logo and all other associated marks. Use of Purdue’s marks without an express license or permission is strictly prohibited. Therefore, only brands and co-brands officially sanctioned and created by Purdue’s Office of Marketing and Communications, such as those to which you may gain access through this process, may be used. No Purdue mark (including any Purdue co-brand or mention of Purdue or Purdue University) may be created, modified, adapted, transformed, reworked, refashioned or changed in any other manner. Failure to comply may result in revocation of permission to use Purdue marks or co-brands as well as other sanctions imposed under authority of the Board of Trustees, and at user’s expense, to remedy the unsanctioned action or use.
